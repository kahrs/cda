The original Unix Circuit Design System (UCDS)  was described in the Unix BSTJ
(July/August 1978) by Sandy Fraser.  This paper has been digitized by
Alcatel-Lucent and is available on:

It initially consisted of an editor for the Tektronix 4014 display and 
a semi-automatic wire-wrap machine.

This was extended by Ken Thompson when he developed the Belle chess machine
with Joe Condon.  Specifically, Ken added the ability to write logical
equations with lde and then minimize them with a Quine-McCluskey optimizer.
He may have also introduced the use of "cdm" to combine netlists from 
different files.

UCDS took off in the mid-1970s when it was used for the CRISP microprocessor
and all of the Datakit Development.  In addition, it was used for Bart
Locanthi's 5620 (Blit) display (and his Gnot machine).  Greg Chesson wrote a simulator
that vanished into the aether.  Mark Kahrs and Tom Killian used CDA to build
Gnusic, a multiprocessor music synthesizer.  Not to be outdone, Jim Snyder
of the Acoustics Lab used UCDS to design numerous DSP boxes including the
world's first portable solid-state AAC player.

When Plan9 arrived, Mark Kahrs decided to port UCDS.  This was done fairly
easily.  However, since Plan9 is not Unix, the decision was made to change the name to CDA (Circuit
Design Aids).  Somehow, Joe Condon convinced Andrew Hume that a new
system for physical layout was needed.  The result was "fizz" and the
associated library.  These tools were used to build
Xunet (a T3-based inter-university network) by Alan Kaplan and Bob Restrick and friends.

When the first Plan9 CD-ROM was released, we decided to include CDA in the distribution.
It was documented and then released.  Subsequent releases of Plan9 omitted CDA.

Now, 20 years later, Mark Kahrs decided to back port it to linux.  This is
the result you see now.

Here is a list of the component programs and their history:

act - written by Restrick, this programs Actel parts
cdmglob - not sure who wrote this, but it replaces cdm (faster)
fizz - written by Andrew Hume, this changed the physical layout software significantly
gnet - written by Bart Locanthi to generate nets from the output of graw
graw - witten by Bart, a replacement for jraw (for the jerq, or 5620 or Blit) which replaced draw,
  the editor for the venerable Tektronix 4014
grawp - generates pic output from drawings
lde - logical equation to minterm converter, written by Ken Thompson
mkpins - generate pin file
part - device partitioner
place - Written by Andrew Hume, this graphical editor is for laying out boards.
pll - Written by Mark Kahrs, this was a first cut at a Phase lock loop designer
quine/cover/hazard - Part of Ken's logical equation compiler (include hazard)
rework - Written by Joe Condon, given a set of wire wraps, this computes the unwrap and wrap commands
  for the semi-automatic wire-wrap machine
rom - rom bit map
smoke - Written by Mark Kahrs, this uses the pin type declarations to find simple static errors
unisite - Writes fuse maps to the Unisite programmer, written by Joe Condon
xil - Xilinx programmer
xnf - Convert to Xilinx netlist format
xpal - Written by Mark Kahrs, this uses a fuse map description written in
  a language called PADDLE.  This was described in IEEE Design and Test.
  It extended the original "pal".
xpart - Extended version of part, probably written by Bob Restrick.
